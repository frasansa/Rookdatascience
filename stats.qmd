In this section, you will find some tips on statistics and data science using R. For most of the entries we will use the functions, style and approaches of the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) universe. In addition, I try to stick to the following conventions in the text:

- Packages should appear as [hyperlinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink) to the package website.
- Table (tibble) names should be in **bold**.
- Column/variable names should be in *italics*.
- Category names and function arguments should be enclosed in single quotes ' '.
- Name of functions() should be in `console` font.
